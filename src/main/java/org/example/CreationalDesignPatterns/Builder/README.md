# Builder

## Purpose:
Builder separates creating complex object from its representation, and because of that the same building process can lead to different representations.

## Use cases:
- If algorithm used to create complex objects, should be independent from components of this object and method of connecting them
- When process of construction has to enable different representations (views) for generated object
