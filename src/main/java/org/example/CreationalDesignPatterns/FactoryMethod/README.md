# ***Factory method***

## Purpose:
Factory method is as creational design pattern that determines the interface to create objects wherein it allows subclasses to designate class of given object.
Factory method allows classes to pass the process of creating instances to the subclasses.


## Use cases:
- When in given class you cannot determine up-front the class of objects that are needed to be created.
- If programmer wants so the subclasses of given class, to determine created objects.
- If classes delegate tasks from one to meany helper subclasses, and the programmer wants to write down in specific place the information about which subclass is the delegate.

## Elements:
- Product - defines interface of objects generated by the __Factory method__.
- ConcreteProduct - covers implementation of __Product__ class.
- Creator  
  - covers declaration of __Factory method__ that returns the objects of __Product__ type; in the object __Creator__ you can also define implementation of default factory method, returning default __Concrete Creator__ object.
  - it can call factory method to generate __Product__ object.
- ConcreteCreator - overrides factory method, so it returns ready example of ConcreteProduct class.
