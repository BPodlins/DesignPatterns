# Design patterns
 
Design patter is something that describes certain, reoccurring problem in specific environment and how to solve it, but in a way that every time can be unique.

**Design pattern consists of four main elements:**

1. *Name of the design*
2. *Description of the problem*
3. *Solution*
4. *Consequences*
