# Design patterns
 
Design patter is something that describes certain, reoccurring problem in specific environment and how to solve it, but in a way that every time can be unique.

**Design pattern consists of four main elements:**

1. *Name of the design*, it is a way to briefly describe the problem, solution and consequences of this solution. It helps with talking about a project using in a bigger abstraction, talking about it to your coworkers and in the documentation.
2. *Description of the problem*, it says when the pattern should be used. It explains the obstacles and context of it.
3. *Solution*, it is a description of elements in the project and how they communicate with each other. It is like a blueprint.
4. *Consequences*, those are effects, costs and gains form using specific design pattern.
